## Microservices Hackathon: RickshawX ‚Äì Smart Mobility for CUET (Year 2050)

---

### üìù Problem Description

**Hackathon Case:** RickshawX ‚Äì Smart Mobility for CUET (Year 2050)

#### The Case
The year is **2050**, and CUET has transformed into a fully smart campus. Even the rickshaw pullers have embraced technology‚Äîusing smartphones to manage their availability, receive ride requests, and accept digital payments. Gone are the days of shouting "51" across Shaheed Minar‚Äînow everything runs on apps and automation.

Your team has been chosen to build the system (web) for a futuristic ride-sharing platform that connects CUET students and rickshaw pullers. The system should be built using **microservice architecture** and support the basic flow of:

- Booking a ride
- Starting a trip
- Ending a trip
- Processing a fare

You are free to design the system as you see fit, but consider real-world needs:
- User registration
- Ride request handling
- Trip management
- Fare calculation
- Mock payment processing and notification

> **Think modular. Think scalable.** Your architecture should reflect how such a system would work in a real smart campus like CUET.
